## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Notes

-   All requests and responses are in JSON.
    
-   Cookie-based session is used for storing selected language.
    
-   Make sure the frontend sends requests with credentials (cookies):
    
    -   `credentials: "include"` in `fetch`
        
    -   `withCredentials: true` in `axios`
        
-   CORS must allow credentials if frontend and backend are on different domains.

## üîê Password Reset Flow 

This flow uses **sessions** to securely track the email across OTP verification and password reset. The user only inputs their email once (at the beginning), and it's managed in the session for subsequent steps.

#### üì§ Expected Response:

```
{

## üõ† Example Frontend Flow

1.  `POST /select-language` ‚Üí store `language` in session
    
2.  `POST /auth/signup` ‚Üí send email, password, and `termsAccepted`
    
3.  `POST /auth/login` ‚Üí log in with email and password

4.  `POST /auth/reset-password` ‚Üí send email and otp is generated by server and sent to user email

5.  `POST /auth/verify-otp` ‚Üí send the otp retrieved from email

6.  `POST /auth/reset/new-password` ‚Üí send the new password


## üîê Google OAuth Authorization

This section explains how to authenticate users via Google OAuth. This flow allows users to either **sign up or log in** using their Google account. A JWT token is issued on success and stored in a secure `httpOnly` cookie.

----------

### üìå Step-by-Step Flow

----------

### 1. **Select Language**

Before redirecting the user to Google, the frontend must call this endpoint to store the user's preferred language in the session.

**Endpoint:**

`POST /select-language` 

**Request Body:**

`{  "language":  "hausa"  }` 

**Response (200 OK):**

`{  "message":  "successfully selected hausa"  }` 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Must be called **before** starting the Google OAuth flow.

----------

### 2. **Start Google OAuth Login**

Redirect the user to this endpoint to initiate Google login.

**Endpoint:**

`GET /google-auth/login` 

**How to Use:**

Use a browser redirect 

**Example:**

`<a  href="http://localhost:PORT/google-auth/login"> <button>Continue with Google</button> </a>` 


----------

### 3. **Callback After Google Auth**

Google redirects back to:

`GET /google-auth/callback` 

Handled internally by the server using Passport ‚Äî no frontend action required here.

-   On success ‚Üí Redirects to `/success`
    
-   On failure ‚Üí Redirects to `/failed`
    

----------

### 4. **Success Response**

**Endpoint:**

`GET /success` 

**Response:**

```
{  
	"success":  true,  
	"data":  {  
		"user":  {  
			"_id":  "userId",  
			"email":  "johndoe@example.com",  
			"username":  "john doe",  
			"language":  "hausa", ... 
		}, 
		"token":  "jwt.token.here"  
	},  
	"message":  "login with google successfully"  
	}
``` 

-   A JWT token is set in a `httpOnly` cookie automatically.
    
-   No need to store the token manually on the frontend.
    

----------

### 5. **Failure Response**

**Endpoint:**

`GET /failed` 

**Response:**

```
{
  "success": false,
  "data": null,
  "message": "Failed to login with Google"
}
```

----------

### ‚úÖ Notes

-   JWT is set as a cookie (`token`), valid for 1 day.
    
-   To make authenticated API requests, include `credentials: 'include'` in `fetch` or `axios` requests.
    
-   Language is stored in the user's profile on signup.
-   OTP is valid for 5 minutes.
    
-   After OTP verification, session is used to track the user's email securely.
    
-   Session expires in 6 minutes or after password reset is complete.
    
-   All responses follow the ```{ code, success, message, data }``` format.
